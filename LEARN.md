# Mouse jiggler LEARN.md

i'm going to detail you how i built this little fun program

1. __Idea__:
i got the idea to create this Mouse-jiggler because i saw people using ***MECHANICAL*** (yes really) mouse-jigglers (that moved your mouse physically) and i thought that it was overkill and i could do it programatically so i wanted to make my own. and also i saw software mouse-jigglers and i wondered how they were made so my "creative" side pushed me to code my own. that's it. so guys first lesson, always let your creative side take over, your learn a lot.

2. __Coding__:
ok so when i started coding i said to my self, __"it's going to be really easy, matter of not even an hour"__, and as programmers, you know guys that it's never like that. it ended-up taking me like a whole day, but i learned a lot about threads and how they work and it was really fun. aside from that i don't have too much to say.

3. __Overall__: it mays look like a simple thing, but you learn a lot from this little projects. anyway if you want to add some feature or something feel free to create pull-requests guys.

### Bye!
